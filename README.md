# Errox_9

# MESSAGE FROM THE DEV!!!
## Errox_9 will be changing languages from Bash to Python on the 2.0 version update, version 1.1 to the most up to date will remain within this repo, if a version is found to be broken it will not be included. Thank you for your time.

## Small note from the dev
Errox_9 is a bash script that uses tools to scan the user's local network for devices using arp-scan. The script is as quiet as I could make it within this first post and will be updated more than once unlike Errox_8. Errox_9 should be getting updated biweekly or so, with this time of the year bringing EOCs and other tests, the updates could take longer than expected.

### Errox_9 version
Version: 1.1
### Needed tools
1) arp-scan
2) ifconfig
3) ipcalc
4) ip
5) grep
6) awk

Version: 1.2
1) arp-scan
2) ifconfig
3) ping
4) arping
5) grep
6) awk

### How to use
Errox_9 is a very user friendly script, but must be ran with sudo perms. Errox_9 is not tested on wireless networks, it has only been tested on ethernet networks within vm software. For details on how each version works, use '-h' when using './Errox_9.sh' inside of its directory. In the even that it doesnt work, please submit it as an issue on 'https://github.com/vel2006/Errox_9'.

## Updates to come:
1) Faster scan time
2) Possible port scanning included
