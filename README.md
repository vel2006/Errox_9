# Errox_9
Errox_9 is a bash script that uses command line tools that are built into Kali Linux . While this tool is not as useful as other tools built into Kali Linux, this can be used on other Linux flavors/distros without raising any eyebrows. Errox_9 is my third publication on GitHub and wont be my last ;)
